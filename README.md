# Abalone-Age-Prediction

Abalone have been a valuable source of food and very nutritious, for human in every area of world where a species is abundant. Before, predicting the age of abalone is done by using physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it so that rings are more prominent, and counting the number rings through the microscope, a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurement, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age of abalone is by using Machine Learning Techniques. The Data Set was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Age prediction of abalone by using physical measurements, a machine learning technique (Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor) is proposed. The model proposed was trained and tested and the accuracy, root mean square error and r2-score was obtained.

The model was trained using the training data set and then tested for the classification and regression on the proposed models. Below diagram shows the results of precision, recall and accuracy. The best model accuracy I got by the KNN is 87.3%.

Image below exhibits the output for the root mean square error and coefficient of determination. The best Model for regression is the gradient boosting with 0.511 R2 score and 0.324 RMSE.
